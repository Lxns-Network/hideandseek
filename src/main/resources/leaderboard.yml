# This config file allows you to change what is displayed on the scoreboard\leaderboard
# while in the lobby, or in the game. Below are a list of predefined placeholders.
#
#   LOBBY BOARD PLACEHOLDERS
#
#   {COUNTDOWN} - Displays the time left in the lobby countdown. If there are not enough
#                 people in the lobby, or the lobby countdown its disabled, it just
#                 displays waiting for players. The text displayed can be changed below.
#   {COUNT}     - The amount of player currently in the lobby.
#   {SEEKER%}   - The chance that a player will be selected to be a seeker.
#   {HIDER%}    - The chance that a player will be selected to be a hider.
#   {MAP}       - The current map the player is on
#
#   GAME BOARD PLACEHOLDERS
#
#   {TIME}      - The amount of time left in the game in MmSs.
#   {TEAM}      - The team you are on. Hider, Seeker, or Spectator.
#   {BORDER}    - The current status of the world boarder, if enabled.
#                 If the world border is disabled, this line is removed
#                 automatically. Displays the time left until the border
#                 moves in MmSs, or "Decreasing" if it's decreasing.
#                 What is displayed exactly can be changed below.
#   {TAUNT}     - The current status of the taunt system, if enabled.
#                 If taunts are disabled, any line with {TAUNT} will be
#                 automatically removed. Shows the time left till next
#                 taunt in MmSs, if the taunt is active, and if the taunt
#                 has expired (one player left). What is displayed exactly
#                 can be changed below.
#   {GLOW}      - The current status of the glow powerup, if enabled.
#                 This line is automatically removed if the glow poewrup
#                 is disabled. Tells all players if a Glow powerup is active,
#                 only Hiders will be able to see its effects though.
